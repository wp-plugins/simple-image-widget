A simple image widget that makes it a breeze to add images to your sidebars.

== Description ==

Simple Image Widget provides the absolute easiest method to quicky add an image to a sidebar or any other widget area. Despite its simplicty, it can be extended by developers via the various hooks to create additional image-based widgets.

Blazer Six took over development and maintenance of Simple Image Widget with version 3.0, rewriting it from the ground up to take advantage of the media improvements in WordPress 3.5. Read about the original thought behind creating this widget and ways it can be extended in [this blog post](http://www.blazersix.com/blog/wordpress-image-widget/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add alt text to images in the widget? =
When selecting an image in the media manager (not in the widget itself), the right section will be titled "Attachment Details" and contains a field for entering your alt text. After entering your alt text, click the "Update Image" button to use the selected image in your widget. You won't be able to see the alt text in most browsers without viewing the HTML source of the page.
